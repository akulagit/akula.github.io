## Data set details
source : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman's+Survival
1. Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)
2. Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)
3. Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)
4. Survival status (class attribute)
-- 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer
-- 2 = the patient died within 5 year


## Objective of EDA
1. Identify the important features to classify survival status of a patient based on 3 features- Age of the patient,year of operation,axillary nodes detected


```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
```


```python
haberman = pd.read_csv("haberman.csv")
print (haberman.head(5))
```

```python
# Changing header names

#haberman = pd.read_csv("haberman.csv")
haberman.columns =['PatientAge','OperationYear','AxilNodes','SurvivalStatus']
print (haberman.head(5))

```

    4          31             65          4               1



```python
# changing the SurvivalStatus label value to be more descriptive 1= "survived more than 5 yrs" and 2= 'Died with in 5 yrs'
haberman['SurvivalStatus'] =haberman['SurvivalStatus'].map({1:'Survived more than 5 yrs',2:'Died with in 5 yrs'})
print (haberman.head(5 ))

Observations from summary statistics of the patient's survival data
1. Patients age range between 30 - 83 year and median age is 52 years
2. Axil nodes vary widely from 1 thorugh 52 but median or 50th percentile of the patients have only 1 node and 75th percentile of the population has 4 or less axil nodes.




## Bi-variate Analysis ( Scatter plots, pair plots)
To identify combination of useful features to classify the patient's survival status


```python
haberman.plot(kind='scatter',x='AxilNodes',y='PatientAge');
plt.title("Scatter Plot for Patient's Age and Axil Nodes")
plt.show()
```


![png](EDA/Example1_13_0.png)



```python
sns.set_style("whitegrid");
sns.FacetGrid(haberman, hue="SurvivalStatus", size=7)\
   .map(plt.scatter,"AxilNodes","PatientAge")\
   .add_legend();
plt.title("Scatter Plot for Patient's Age and Axil Nodes")
plt.show();

```


![png](EDA/Example1_14_0.png)


Observation based on Patient's age and number of Axil nodes diagnosed with.
1. Survival chances are high when axillary nodes are 1 or below
2. Survival chances are very slim when axillary nodes are 20 or above
3. Data is more concentated for age group 40-60 yrs


```python
sns.set_style("whitegrid");
sns.FacetGrid(haberman, hue="SurvivalStatus", size=7)\
   .map(plt.scatter,"PatientAge","OperationYear")\
   .add_legend();
plt.title("Scatter Plot for Patient's Age and Operation Year")
plt.show();
```


![png](EDA/Example1_16_0.png)


Observation: Data is much scattered for patient's age and year of operation plot. No significant inferences are
possible with this plot



```python


plt.close();
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
g = sns.pairplot(haberman, hue="SurvivalStatus", size=4,);
g.fig.suptitle("Pair Plots for Haberman features",y=1)
plt.show()

```


![png](EDA/Example1_18_0.png)



```python
Pair plot observation: No Pair plot among the three features  providing clear seperation of Survival status classes.
```


      File "<ipython-input-27-d89b74a1d9aa>", line 1
        Pair plot observation: No Pair plot among the three features  providing clear seperation of Survival status classes.
                ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax



##  Histograms and probability density functions (PDF)
Univariant Analysis using for Patient's Age, Operation Year, Axil nodes respectively


```python
for idx, feature in enumerate ( list ( haberman.columns)[:-1]):
    sns.FacetGrid(haberman, hue='SurvivalStatus', size=6,)\
     .map(sns.distplot,feature)\
     .add_legend();
    plt.title("Histogram & PDF for " + feature)

plt.show()
```

Histogram & PDF Observation :
   1. patient's age and operation year PDF are highly overlapping, so patient's survival is not
    easily distinguishable using both these features.

   2. On the other hand Axil Nodes Pdf showing very sharp peak at zero node for patients surviving more than 5 years
    and survival rate is declining with increase of Axil nodes


## Cumulative Density functions


```python
counts, bin_edges = np.histogram(haberman['AxilNodes'], bins=10,
                                 density = True)

pdf = counts/(sum(counts))
print(pdf);
print(bin_edges);
cdf = np.cumsum(pdf)
plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf);
plt.plot(bin_edges[1:], cdf)
plt.title( "CDF for Axil nodes")

counts, bin_edges = np.histogram(haberman['AxilNodes'], bins=20,
                                 density = True)
pdf = counts/(sum(counts))
plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf);

plt.show();

```python
Observation : Around 80% patients have less than five axil nodes
```

# Box Plots
Univarient analysis using Box plots for Patient's Age, Operation year, Axil Nodes


```python
plt.close();

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(15,5));
for idx, feature in enumerate ( list ( haberman.columns)[:-1]):
   sns.boxplot( x='SurvivalStatus', y= feature, data = haberman , ax=axes[idx]).set_title('Box Plot for '+feature)
plt.show()


```


![png](EDA/Example1_27_0.png)


Box plots observation :

   Using box plot for Axilnodex
    1.75th percentile of the patient's survived have less than five axil nodes.
    2 Several outliners observed in data set for patients survived more than 5 years
    3.75th percentile of patients died with in five years having  axil nodes less than 11

   Using box plot for operation year
     1. 50th - 75th  percentile of died patient's numbers declined during years 63-65 at the same time survival numbers have      improved.
    2. 50th percentile of suvival and Death rate is below 63 years. During this time frame death rate spread is more than survival rate


# Violin Plots
Univarient analysis using Violin plots for Patient's Age, Operation year, Axil Nodes


```python

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(15,5))
for idx, feature in enumerate ( list ( haberman.columns)[:-1]):
    sns.violinplot( x='SurvivalStatus', y= feature, data = haberman , ax=axes[idx]).set_title('Violin Plot for '+feature)
plt.show()
```


![png](EDA/Example1_30_0.png)


Violin plot observation:

    1. Data spread for survival rate and death rate is almost similar for patient's age and operation year respectively.
    2. In Axil nodes plot, data is densely populated closer to zero for survived patients.
    3. In Axil nodes plot, patients died below five years, data is less densely populated around zero compared to survived     patients,also data is sparsely scattered for higher number of nodes.

# Conclusion
Using exploratory analysis, among three features provided, number of Axil nodes provides definitive information on patient's survival rate. Patients with Axil nodes less four have better survival rates.
